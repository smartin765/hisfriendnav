<h1><b>John F Kennedy: Inspirational Leader</b></h1>

      <p><span class="regular-text">John F. Kennedy, or JFK, was the 35th President of the United States. He was born on May 29, 1917, in Massachusetts. JFK was a brave and inspiring leader who believed in the importance of working together to make the world a better place. He encouraged people to be kind to one another and to help those in need.

One of the most famous things about JFK is that he gave a speech where he said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.' This meant that he wanted everyone to think about how they could help make America a great country.

Sadly, JFK's time as president was cut short when he was tragically shot and killed in 1963. Even though he is no longer with us, we remember him as a president who wanted to make the world a better and more peaceful place for everyone.<span></p>

Today, people still talk about Socrates and his teachings. He is often considered one of the greatest philosophers in history. So, Socrates was a wise teacher who loved asking questions to help people learn and think for themselves.<span></p>

    <h1>Biography: Socrates</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Early Life:</p>
 <p>Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher who lived a long time ago, around 469-399 BCE. He didn't write down his thoughts, so we know about him from what his friends wrote and talked about.</p>

 <p>The Thinker:</p>
 <p>Socrates loved to think and ask questions. He wasn't like other teachers who gave answers; instead, he made people think for themselves. He believed that asking questions and discussing ideas made people smarter.</p>

 <p>The Barefoot Philosopher:</p>
 <p>Socrates didn't care much about fancy clothes or a big house. He often walked around Athens, the city where he lived, barefoot and in simple clothing. He wanted people to focus on their minds, not on how things looked.</p>

 <p>The Socratic Method:</p>
 <p>Socrates had a special way of teaching called the "Socratic Method." Instead of giving direct answers, he asked lots of questions. This made his students think deeply and figure things out on their own.</p>

 <p>Trial and Legacy:</p>
 <p>Socrates got into trouble because some people didn't like his ideas. They accused him of not believing in the gods of the city and corrupting the youth. In the end, he was put on trial and sentenced to drink poison. Socrates accepted his fate calmly, teaching us about facing challenges with courage.<p>

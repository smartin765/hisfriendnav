<h1><b>Ulysses S. Grant: American General and President</b></h1>

      <p><span class="regular-text">
Ulysses S. Grant was a famous American general and the 18th president of the United States. He was born in 1822 and became a key figure during the American Civil War, which took place from 1861 to 1865. Grant led the Union forces (the Northern states) to victory over the Confederate forces (the Southern states) in the Civil War.

One of Grant's most important accomplishments was accepting General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in 1865, effectively ending the Civil War. People admired Grant for his military skills and determination.

Later, in 1869, he became the president of the United States and served two terms. During his presidency, he worked to rebuild the country after the Civil War and promote civil rights for African Americans. Grant is remembered as a heroic general and an important leader in American history.<span></p>
